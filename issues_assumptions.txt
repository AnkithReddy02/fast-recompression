1. RadixSort method is done only on first two numbers of a tuple. [Thats's enough for now]
2. Input 'arr' to Bcomp(at the initial stage) should be starting from 1 to **max.** of arr.size().
3. LCE Queries doesn't work for length 1.
4. For LCE Queries to work, there is some modification to the original algorithm in step 5.
    Reason:
    Take the example from Tomohiro's paper.
    Consider Indices 6 and 30 and dry run it.
5. Node.l = startIndex of Node, Node.r = endIndex + 1 of Node.
6. Yet to modify adjList. Also, there should be only one parameter that is adjList to the createPartition.
7. Input should be taken from the file and each character mapped to a variable(Nonterminal)
